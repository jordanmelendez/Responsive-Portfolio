			<p> 
				Jordan Melendez was born on the same day Wayne Gretzky became the first NHL player to reach 2,000 career points. That same season, the Chicago Bulls won their first of six NBA championships, coincidence? I'll let you decide. After 26 years of knowing Jordan, I'd be lying if I said Jordan isn't one of the most interesting person I've ever had the pleasure of being around. Oh, who am I? Let's just say I'm one of Jordan's closest confidants. 
				</p>

			<p>
				But enough about me. I've been instructed to give you, the reader, a bit of information on who Jordan Melendez is. He is a graduate of DePaul University C/O 2014, although, he is not particularly fond of his alma mater for reasons that will surely come to light when the time is right. When Jordan isn't sparring with Chuck Norris, he can be found in the corner of his favorite coffes shop people watching while he listens to the Joe Rogan Experience on youtube. I often accompany Jordan during these excursions, sitting nearby in the event some poor soul contemplates on disrupting him from his moment of Zen. Legend has (allegedly) that the last person to bother Jordan while he's listening to JRE is now playing spades with Harambe. I'm sure in due time Jordan will allow me to say more, but until then...
